/**
 *
 * ## The essence of the pattern.
 *
 * * A facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simple interface to a
 *   complex class system, library, or framework.
 *
 *
 * ## Analogy from life.
 *
 * * When you call a store and place an order over the phone, a customer support person
 *   is your front to all services and departments of the store. It provides you with a
 *   simplified interface to the order creation system, payment system and shipping department.
 *
 *
 * ## Applicability.
 *
 * * When you need to present a simple interface to a complex subsystem.
 *
 *   Subsystems often become more complex as the program develops. Applying most patterns
 *   results in smaller classes, but in larger numbers. It is easier to reuse such a subsystem,
 *   adjusting it each time for specific needs, but at the same time, it becomes more difficult
 *   to use the subsystem without tuning. The faÃ§ade offers a certain default system view that
 *   suits most clients.
 *
 * * When you want to decompose a subsystem into separate layers.
 *
 *   Use facades to define entry points for each level of the subsystem.
 *   If subsystems depend on each other, then the dependency can be simplified by allowing
 *   subsystems to exchange information only through facades.
 *
 * ## Implementation steps:
 *
 * (1) Determine if you can create a simpler interface than the complex subsystem provides.
 *     You are on the right track if this interface saves the client from having to know about
 *     the details of the subsystem.
 *
 * (2) Create a facade class that implements this interface. It should forward client calls
 *     to the desired subsystem objects. The facade will have to take care to properly initialize
 *     the subsystem objects.

   * (3) You will get maximum benefit if the client only works with the facade. In this case,
   *     changes to the subsystem will affect only the facade code, and the client code will remain
   *     working.
