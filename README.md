# Patterns in Dart

What is a Pattern?

A design pattern is a common solution to a specific problem in software architecture design.

Unlike ready-made functions or libraries, a pattern cannot be simply taken and copied into a program. A pattern is not a specific code, but a general concept of solving a particular problem, which will still need to be adjusted to the needs of your program.

Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problem. But if an algorithm is a clear set of actions, then a pattern is a high-level description of a solution, the implementation of which may differ in two different programs.

By analogy, an algorithm is a recipe with clear steps, and a pattern is an engineering drawing that draws a solution, but not specific steps to implement it.
